#. Description of the plugin/theme
msgid ""
"The Silver Quantum theme has been upgraded to enhance its responsiveness, "
"ensuring an optimal viewing experience on smartphones and tablets. It "
"incorporates a variety of features, including the ability to customize the "
"header, the addition of left and right sidebars, support for featured "
"images, and more. One distinctive attribute of this theme is its unique "
"mobile menu design. Unlike other themes, Silver Quantum positions its "
"mobile menu at the bottom left corner of the screen, making navigation more "
"intuitive and user-friendly for mobile users. This strategic placement "
"allows for easier access and a smoother browsing experience on handheld "
"devices."
